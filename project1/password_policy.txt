I studied the Microsoft passkey manager, as well as LastPass and 1Password. I actually already had all of them setup as I have had to use all of them at my co-op. I like Microsoft's password and 2FA system the best as itâ€™s 2FA authenticator app seems to be on of most widely used. As for 1Password and LastPass, I have had to use both on co-op. Originally we had LastPass, but it eventually got breached so our cyber team decided it was best to switch to 1Password. However it seems like a breach is inevitable with most of these services, so I am always skeptical as to how much good switching platforms can do.
